Use gallery walk to practice public speaking:\\nSince each presenter is going to present multiple times, your student talking time is going to increase dramatically compared to presenting one at a time. Gallery walk also lowers the stakes since each student presents to a smaller group instead of the whole class and gets multiple chances to practice and improve their public speaking skills. \\n\\n2. Use gallery walk as an autobiographical introduction activity:\\nAsk students to create an artifact, poster, or presentation that tells a little about who they are. Then use gallery walk to have them present this artifact to the class. Ask students to come up with question before-hand that they can ask to the presenters after each presentation.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":36}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":670,"height":377,"strokewidth":0}},"width":670,"height":377,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6HcMLVETi2W"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":false,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
